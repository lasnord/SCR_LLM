Risks are listed in the following formula: {name_of_risk,[examples_of_cause_of_risk],[examples_of_effects_risk_has_on_supply_chain]} and ; separating the different risks. {Political Risk,[Terrorism, trade wars, export bans, nationalization of industries, unstable government policies],[Border closures delaying goods, regulatory uncertainty, increased tariffs, disrupted sourcing, cost increases due to rerouting]};{Environmental Risk,[Floods, wildfires, droughts, earthquakes, hurricanes, extreme weather affecting transport or raw materials],[Delayed shipments, damaged inventory, reduced material availability, shutdowns of manufacturing hubs, increased procurement costs]};{Financial Risk,[Bankruptcy of suppliers, currency volatility, economic recession, delayed payments, loss of investor confidence],[Cash flow disruption, halted supplier operations, increased borrowing costs, renegotiation of contracts, withdrawal from markets]};{Supply Risk,[Supplier monopoly, poor quality control, single-source dependency],[Production delays, recalls, increased sourcing costs, customer dissatisfaction, emergency supplier onboarding]};{Demand Risk,[Forecast errors, unexpected market shifts, new competitor products, changing customer preferences],[Overstock or stockouts, lost sales, increased holding costs, inefficiencies in upstream planning, resource misallocation]};{Logistics Risk,[Inefficiencies in logistics operations, customs delays, container shortages, infrastructure failures],[Delivery delays, increased shipping costs, production halts, order backlogs, use of expensive express transport]};{System Risk,[IT integration issues, outdated ERP systems, software bugs],[Order mismanagement, data inaccuracy, downtime in planning systems, reduced operational visibility, manual workarounds]};{Operational Risk,[Worker strikes, Human errors, equipment breakdown, poor process design, safety incidents, labor shortage],[Production downtime, quality issues, increased cost per unit, missed deadlines, shipment errors]};{Social Risk,[Unsafe labor conditions, community opposition, legal disputes, reputational scandals],[Factory closures, supplier termination, loss of contracts, boycotts, increased compliance costs]};{Cybersecurity Risk,[Data breaches, ransomware, phishing, weak security protocols in SCM software],[Halted operations, data theft, regulatory fines, compromised customer trust, disrupted digital communication]};{Behavioral Risk,[Poor cross-functional coordination, hidden agendas in supplier relationships, unbalanced information exchange between suppliers],[Forecast inaccuracies, misaligned goals, delayed decision-making, inefficiency, unaddressed vulnerabilities, bullwhip effect]};{Cultural Risk,[Language barriers, different work ethics, resistance to digital tools, misinterpretation in global teams],[Poor collaboration, delays in negotiations, reduced operational consistency, conflict in joint ventures, lowered efficiency]}. The risks are better identified based on the causes than the actual effects it has on the supply chain (e.g. risk caused by severe weather is an environmental risk or risk caused by strikes is an operational risk). Please try and detect these kind of supply chain risks and information related to them from this news article \" + article.text + \". If you detect a supply chain risk, please list information about the risk in the following string format: <risk_category>,<description_of_risk>,<cause_of_risk>,<supply_chain_entities_present_in_risk_separated_by_;>,<geographical_locations_separated_by_;>,<business_sectors_affected_separated_by_;>,<\"+url+\">. Don't use any extra commas, other than the ones in the aforementioned format. Don't generate any extra ',' characters, as the result is used to create a csv-file. If name of geographical location includes a ',' character (e.g. county, state), replace it with a space. If you don't recognize some information, replace it with 'No information'. Only include risks if the entities related to the risks are clearly, uniquely and explicitly disclosed in the news article and extract those entities. Don't generate only general-level entities, but try to generate more in detail identification for all identities (e.g. company name). Only generate unique identification of entities that are explicitly mentioned in the news article. Include the events in a string form list in the following format: <risk_1>&<risk_2>&<risk_n>. Generate an answer that only contains the list.\"\n",
